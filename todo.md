# TO DO
1. Get basic drawing (export/import) and visualization going.
2. Define and implement artist module (final renderer, before export) -- This means deciding how to do tech file integration
3. Link netlist, stylesheet to artist module
4. Build features


## artist
1. BJT process variant? or BiCMOS?
2. Should fully type-check arguments @ artist?
3. Better lib structure
4. Make contactHelper capable of multiple columns?
5. Make contactHelper better at trimming overrunning contacts?
